# vShell (DISCONTINUED)

***

[vShell] (Virtual Shell) â€” a successor of [Termux] project which provides an
alternate implementation of the Linux terminal emulator for Android OS.

Unlike the original, this application uses [QEMU] to emulate x86_64 hardware to
run [Alpine Linux] distribution. This approach allows to provide a sane
distribution independent of Android OS, with own kernel and full root access
giving full control over the system. Unlike Termux, vShell does not need to port
software packages to Android OS. As result, there are more packages and their
quality is much higher.

This application is compatible with any Android OS versions beginning from 7.0.
It is not affected by Android security hardening like Termux, see issue about
`execve()`: https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/1072.

Closest alternatives:
- [iSH]: Linux shell terminal for IOS devices. User mode emulation.
- [UserLAnd]: Rootless Linux distribution chroot for Android OS. Uses `proot`.

*[vShell] is a private project even though it is Free and Open Source. It has
been developed specifically for my needs. Considering that Android development
is not my occupation and neither my hobby, do not expect the great UX, elegant
coding solutions and so on. vShell is not newbie friendly and never was
intended to be such. If you are not skilled in Linux systems, you will not have
much success with this application.*

*Remember that I do not provide any kind of mentorship on using the packaged
Linux distribution.* **Read the f\*\*\*ing documentation!** See links below:

* Built-in application usage help: long click on terminal -> "Help". Unformatted
  markdown page is available online here: [user-guide/guide.md.in](/user-guide/guide.md.in).

## Where to download

You can [download] the latest version from the [GitHub Releases] page.

Check the [LIMITATIONS.md](./LIMITATIONS.md) to learn about functional limits
of this software.

For instructions about building the own copy of application, please check
[BUILDING.md](./BUILDING.md).

*This application is not distributed via Play Store, F-Droid, alternate stores,
Facebook, YouTube and other social media.*

## Properties of emulated VM

Overview of used QEMU configuration.

Note that you cannot change configuration from the application itself. If you
want to adjust QEMU settings, you will need to create your own vShell build.

**CPU:**

1-core x86 64-bit, with all features enabled.

Having multiple emulated cores there is pointless. They will be executed within
the same QEMU thread and as result there would not be any performance benefits.
Though if this will be implemented, e.g. unstable MTTCG will be enabled, this
will have serious impact on battery drain. So 1 core is the optimal value.

**RAM:**

Depends on how much of **free** RAM is available on device.

If you want to maximize the available RAM for the VM, you will need to close
all heavy apps before starting vShell. Maximal amount of memory which VM can
allocate is 2 GiB.

**HDD:**

64 GB dynamic QCOW2 image.

Default operating system installation is diskless, i.e. everything is stored in
RAM except data from HDD partitions. There is a 4 GB partition for user data,
like /home and /root user directories and package cache. When made some changes
to system, do not forget to use `lbu` to save them on disk.

Since partition is bootable, you can re-install Alpine Linux or other operating
system on it, if do not want to use diskless distribution variant.

**Host storage:**

Device shared storage is mounted as `/media/host` via 9P file system mounted
with tag `host_storage`.

This is handled by `/etc/fstab`.

**Network:**

Only user-mode networking via SLiRP is supported.

Default DNS in `/etc/resolv.conf`:
```
# Google DNS which should work for everyone.
nameserver 8.8.8.8

# Fallback QEMU DNS resolver. Uses 1.1.1.1 CloudFlare DNS as upstream.
nameserver 10.0.2.3
```

Ports 22 and 80 are forwarded to random ports on host. Long tap on terminal
screen to see the current port forwardings in context menu.

## Known Issues

For now there is only one major issue which doesn't happen under normal cases.
It is related to host storage mount point exported through VirtFS and leads
to application force-close when you are trying to list current working directory
that is already deleted on host. I can't provide fix for that and this seem
to be a general QEMU issue.
